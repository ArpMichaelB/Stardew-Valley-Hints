#Stardew Valley Hints

This is, quite simply, a skill for the Amazon Alexa which goes and searches the Stardew Valley wiki. 
The bulk of the work done in the code is on the backend, which does the following:

1. Pulls the full page requested by the user
2. Extracts the basic description of the item from the page
3. Returns the description that was extracted to alexa, to show to the user.
